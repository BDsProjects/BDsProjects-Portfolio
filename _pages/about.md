<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> As a First Generation College Student, I had the goal to graduate in an engineering field to provide myself with a stable and good income for my future. One of the reasons I chose Mechanical Engineering, was enjoying the problem solving approach in my high school physics and math classes. I have always been curious as to what is required to make mechanical and electrical devices function, and mechanical engineering presented the best path forward. Once I succeded in my sophmore ME undergraduate classes, I started to focus on Aerospace Engineering. 
</p>

<h1>Educational Background</h1>
<p>I graduated from the University of Dayton with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Aerospace Engineering in May 2024. During my time at UD during undergraduate studies, I participated in the ASME chapter, intramural sports, UD Esports as a founding member, player, and as an assistant with the Student Development Office for UD Esports. I also participated in the UD Aerospace Propulsion Outreach Program through the Air Force Research Labs asd part of both senior design classes, MEE 431L and MEE 432L. I completed three graduate level classes as part of the Bachelor's Plus Master's Program, and now I am pursuing my Master's of Science in Aerospace Engineering full time continuing in Fall 2024, and expecting to graduate in August of 2025. I will focus on deep space exploration mission design as a member of the STEP Cohort.

<h1>Activities, Hobbies, and Interests</h1>
<p>
Related, to engineering, I do 3D modeling, 3D printing, and programming across many topics. My main programming interests are spread across topics including propulsion, machine learning, flight dynamics, data analysis, physics applications, and other areas. 
</p>
<p>
Outside of engineering related activities, I have other hobbies such as Playing Various Sports: Sand Volleyball, Soccer, Basketball, Football, and many more, Reading, Traveling, and Video Games. We played intramurals as a large group at UD, but I also play in recreational leagues when back in Cleveland too.
