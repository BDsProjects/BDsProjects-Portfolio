## Project Overview
A project born from issues faced during the construction of the JetOp app. This is being developed for the use in decompilation and reverse engineering of older software, as a learrning process in machine learning, and a precursor project for some of my other machine learning ideas. This is written in python and is currently based in a transfornmer architecture. This is the first attempt at building a machine learning project from scratch. 

I am building a simple integrated UI to show progress in a different format, then the typical terminal view. I set this up as I run this is a secondary or thrid monitor, or in another setup on a further away display. This allows me to view its progress at a distance or from another monitor.
