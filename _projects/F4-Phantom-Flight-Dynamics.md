## Class Details
I took the Graduate Level course, AEE 521: Flight Dynamics as my second dual credit Master's class, and third Master's class overall at UDayton. This class and the associated projects revolved around the fundamental theory of flight being applied to a randomly selected aircraft for static and dynamic conditions. This class had a mathematical focus on the lateral and longitudinal differential equations of motion applied in 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) using Quaternions for rotational changes during the simulated conditions. The aircraft motion was modeled with Matlab and Simulink across multiple assignments and two projects. Project 1 focused on small perturbations in steady, level, flight.
