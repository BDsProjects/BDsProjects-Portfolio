## Project Overview
The AFRL APOP Competition is given as a senior design project spanning the fall and spring semesters for UDayton's MEE 431L and MEE 432L 'capstone' classes.  This competition centers around research and design of small turbine technology. For the 2023-2024 competition,  the topic is researching, designing, and creating a thrust reverser on a JetCAT P100-RX. As this project is worked into the senior design classes, tthe full length of the project included designs reviews and milestone meetings with both UD and the AFRL mentor team, midterm and final presentations for both semesters, and a final report covering all work done in the first semester, and all work to date including testing results from the testing completed at AFRL's facility. 

I had many diverse roles within the project but was primarily responsible for mathematical models of the thrust reverser, cycle analysis of the turbine, CFD modeling of the stock nozzle and thrust reversers, documentation creation/upkeep, and data integrity. 

I am currently reverse engineering and redesigning of the turbine software to provide a better and more detailed interface. This will contain more features than the standard app, while also being built in modern languages, Python and Arduino. This will be completed by the next APOP project, starting at the end of August 2024. I am also working on data-integrity and handoff measures for the future competition teams at UD.
