## About Me

I graduated from the University of Dayton with a Bachelor’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Aerospace Engineering in May 2024. During my time at UD, I participated in the ASME chapter, intramural sports, UD Esports as a founding member, player, and as an assistant with the Student Development Office for UD Esports. I also participated in the UD Aerospace Propulsion Outreach Program through the Air Force Research Labs asd part of both senior design classes, MEE 431L and MEE 432L. I completed three graduate level classes as part of the Bachelor’s Plus Master’s Program, and now I am pursuing my Master’s of Science in Aerospace Engineering full time continuing in Fall 2024, and expecting to graduate in August of 2025. I will focus on deep space exploration mission design as a member of the STEP Cohort.

During my undergraduate degree, I completed four full time internships/Co-ops as a manufacturing intern, Project Engineering Intern, Product Investigations Co-op, and Manufacturing Engineering Co-op. I was also a Mechanical Engineering intern, part-time during my first senior semester in Fall 2023, and started part-time as a Research Engineer at the end of that semester. I continued the role part-time through my Spring 2024 final semester, and now work part-to-full time as a Research Engineer during my full time classes in Fall 2024.

With my current slate of projects, the Jet powered Go-Kart is my main focus. I will be working to document the process on social media to be posted at a later date. I will be keeping likely everything related to its design and development on the Jet-Go-Kart repository as well, including the 3D modeling and blueprints.
